1. ABSTRACT: Healthy life is very important for a human. Being fitness for long time until 
death we must be healthy. If we want to being healthy in our daily life we 
must be follow some rules. A healthy person can easily do work in daily life 
without tension. Because in our life, Health is very important for us. So If we 
maintain a healthy life then it will be biggest things we ever had. The first exemplifies a historical failure to match rhetoric with action. The report promises to help local health services deal with inequalities: “We are giving primary care trusts the means to tackle health inequalities and improve health through funding to give greater priority to areas of high health need...” This implies recognition of the need to provide greater resources to those primary care trusts in most need in order to move disadvantaged people up to the level of advantaged people.
2.Ensure  white papers useful
If you solve your client’s pain points well, selling becomes a natural part of the conversation. Go the extra mile. Give clients creative solutions to the problems they have or combine it in fun ways they have never considered. In light of policy changes, you may help providers be more effective with digital health technologies like yours. Perhaps you can provide CEO’s with evidence on the efficacy of a public health research approach they can use.

3. THE CHALLENGE 
By Linda Meyer, Ed.D., MPA, BCBA-D, CPT and Barbara Wells, DTR 
“Physical activity is the closest thing we have to a wonder drug. Unfortunately, many adults with disabilities don’t get regular physical activity.” – CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. 
Targeting fitness is important idea for many reasons. Regular exercise can promote health and fitness, increase lean body mass, strengthen muscle, and improve social and communication skills, heart and lung functioning, balance, flexibility and appearance. Achieving an appropriate fitness level can help individuals with autism participate more fully with their families in leisure time activities and everyday household chores, as well as within educational, vocational and community environments. So, we know the value of a regular fitness routine, so why don’t we, “... just do it?” Here are some helpful tips for getting started: 
Begin with the end in mind. Have specific outcome goals. Select a program and develop individualized goals which can address the reason or reasons you want your participant to enroll in a program. Possible reasons for sending your child or learner to a program could include: learning a sports-related skill, 
increasing opportunities for socialization and inclusion, increasing fitness levels or respite for caregivers. 
4. THE BENEFITS OF MOVING
The great thing about moving is that just a few minutes a day can have lasting benefits, many of which you may not even be aware of. 
Just some of the benefits include: 
• Reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes 
• Improves joint stability 
• Increases and improves range of motion 
• Helps maintain flexibility as you age 
• Maintains bone mass 
• Prevents osteoporosis and fractures 
• Improves mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression 
• Enhances self-esteem 
• Improves memory in elderly people 
• Reduces stress 
Even if you opt for small changes and a more modest weight loss, you can see the benefits are still pretty amazing. 
5. HOW TO GET INTO HEALTHY LIFE : You can start the process of being healthy and now by adding a little more activity to your life. If you are not ready for a structured program, start small. Every little bit counts and it all adds up to burning more calories. 
• Turn off the TV and computer. Once a week, turn off the TV and computer and do something a little more physical with your family. Play games, take a walk, do almost anything that will be more active than sitting on the couch. 
• Walk more. Look for small ways to walk more. When you get the mail, take a walk around the block, take the dog for an extra outing each day, or walk on your treadmill for five minutes before getting ready for work. 
• Do some chores. Shoveling snow, working in the garden, raking leaves, sweeping the floor—these kinds of activities may not be vigorous exercise, but they can keep you moving while getting your house in order. 
• Pace while you talk. When you're on the phone, pace around or even do some cleaning while gabbing. This is a great way to stay moving while doing something you enjoy. 
• Be aware. Make a list of all the physical activities you do on a typical day. If you find that the bulk of your time is spent sitting, make another list of all the ways you could move more—getting up each hour to stretch or walk, walk the stairs at work, etc. 
5. 1. Eating Well Without Being Miserable 
Eating a healthy diet is another part of the healthy lifestyle. Not only can a clean diet help with weight management, it can also improve your health and quality of life as you get older. You already know about the food groups and the fact that you should eat more fruits and vegetables and less processed foods. You probably have a list of things you know you should do for a healthier diet but, again, making too many changes at once can backfire. Going on a restrictive diet may make you crave the very foods you are trying to avoid. 
Another approach is to look for ways to make smaller changes each day. Just a few ideas for changing how you eat include: 
• Eat more fruit. Add it to your cereal, salads, dinners, or make it a dessert. Fruit is also a great snack after work or school to keep you going for dinner. 
• Sneak in more veggies. Add them wherever you can—a tomato on your sandwich, peppers on your pizza, or extra veggies in your pasta sauce. Keep pre-cut, canned, or frozen veggies ready for quick snacks. 
• Try a healthy salad dressing. If you eat full-fat dressing, switch to something lighter and you will automatically eat fewer calories. 
• Eat low fat or fat-free dairy. Switching to skim milk or fat-free yogurt is another simple way to eat fewer calories without having to change too much in your diet. 
• Make some substitutions. Look through your cabinets or fridge and pick three foods you eat every day. Write down the nutritional content and, the next time you are at the grocery store, find lower-calorie substitutes for just those three items. 

6. Use white papers strategically:  White paper distribution is an essential marketing strategy for healthcare startups, not a stand alone tactic. Consider how white papers fit into your overall business development strategy. For example, you could host white papers on a landing page designed to generate leads and build your email list. You could also release white papers to build trust with potential clients or provide more value for existing clients who read your blog. You might even distribute white papers on free PR sites or hire a PR firm to disseminate them for you.
7. Forget fake news
You are most likely talking to people who know their stuff. Your audience likely includes the public (who are interested in the control of their care and health decisions now more than ever) or CEO’s who have their finger on the pulse of the industry. Make sure to back up your statements with highly credible sources. In the healthcare space this includes academic journals, or reputable organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization–amongst others. Wikipedia or news articles are not generally consider credible research sources.




8. CONCLUSION: Creating a healthy lifestyle does not have to mean drastic changes. Making small changes in how you live may seem like a slow process, and it is. You may adapt to change better when it does not require you to overhaul your entire life. Just pick one thing and work on that one thing every day, letting the rest of your life and habits stay the same. You may be surprised that those small changes really can make a difference.
